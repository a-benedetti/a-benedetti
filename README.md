## Hi there!

I'm a CADD graduate and I specialize in structural bioinformatics, machine learning and pharmaceutical data science. 

My passion for coding started back in 2008, I was 10 years old, and using a free domain I started my own little web design service for a network of fan clubs ran by teenagers. I've come a long way since then, I picked up Python and learned to love scientific computing, and then fell into the rabbit hole of computational drug discovery and protein science. In my spare time I enjoy working on some personal projects to make drug discovery and pharmaceutical science more accessible for everyone.
