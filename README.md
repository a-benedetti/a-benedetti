## Hi there!

I'm a CADD graduate and I specialize in structural bioinformatics and pharmaceutical data science. In my spare time I enjoy working on some personal projects to make drug discovery and pharmaceutical science more accessible for everyone. If you're interested in seeing how I code, feel free to take a look at my latest work in progress, [inStruct]([url](https://github.com/a-benedetti/inStruct)).
